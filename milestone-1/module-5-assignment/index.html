                    time projects and my mentoring also extend my horizon. The regular meeting of developers, which I'm
                    organizing, is a fun, informative and empowering event. I've played with more technologies,
                    architectures and systems than ever before.

                        long-term goal could be to learn website coding over the next four weeks. While that long-term
                        goal will motivate you initially, we need to aim for smaller wins to keep our spirits up in
                        the long run.
                        That's why breaking up big long-term goals into smaller short-term goals is so important. For
                        instance, we can challenge ourself to build an online resume with HTML to start with. We can
                        then take it a step further by using CSS to make it look pretty. By breaking goals down like
